# Node

Welcome to the Node backend! 

There's nothing to be done here for the interview set-up, but feel free to look around! ðŸ‘€

## Setup

From the project root run  `script/node/setup`

## Starting the server

From the project root run  `script/node/start`

## Project structure

`app.js` starts the server and all code lives in `./node/lib`

## Database

This project uses lowdb as a lightweight JSON database. All the settings can be found in `node/lib/db.js`. The database will be saved into a file called `db.json`.
