# Minicom

Welcome to Minicom! A prototype Intercom service. This is a project to help you set up for your interview later on. Inside this directory you'll find a foo website, a bar website, and servers that represent a simplified version of how Intercom works.

# What do I have to do?

Follow the setup instructions mentioned in the sections below and once that is accomplished, you should be able to get the prototype running.

1. Run Foo at http://127.0.0.1:8008, verify that an alert with `Yay! Everything works` fires
2. Run Bar at http://127.0.0.1:8009, verify that an alert with `Yay! Everything works` fires

ðŸ¥³ If those worked, well done! You're all set for the interview!

ðŸ¤” If not, please let us know ahead of the interview. We want to make sure you have it all set up before the interview day.

## Installation

Choose your preferred framework. The current choices available are:
```
rails
spring
node
django
```
anywhere you see `{your-framework}` in the instructions below, replace it with the keyword above.

Run the command that matches your framework to install it.

```
# Mac/Linux/Windows with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
script/{your-framework}/setup

# Windows without WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
script\{your-framework}\setup

(examples)

script/rails/setup
script/spring/setup
script/node/setup
script/django/setup
```

## Getting started

Run the following commands in 3 different terminal windows:

```
script/foo/start
script/bar/start
script/{your-framework}/start
```

This will get you the foo site running at http://127.0.0.1:8008, the bar interface running at http://127.0.0.1:8009 and a webserver running at http://127.0.0.1:3000.

## About this project

You can read more below about this project, but it's not required before the interview.   
 
### Structure

A quick overview of the application structure:

- **foo/** -- The root of the foo interface.
- **bar/** -- The root of the bar website.

Your framework will have a folder with it's name and have 2 endpoints:

- **POST /foo/** (validates that the frontend can talk to backend)
- **POST /bar/** (validates that the frontend can talk to backend)

### Folders

Each Server framework is in its own folder (named after the framework) and has its own Readme. You can safely ignore anything in the frameworks that you are not using.

- [Rails](./rails/README.md)
- [Spring](./spring/README.md)
- [Django](./django/README.md)
- [Node](./node/README.md)
